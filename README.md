# Network Socket and HTML Project

A network programming project that combines socket communication with HTML interfaces, demonstrating client-server architecture and web technologies.

## About

This project implements network communication using sockets along with HTML-based user interfaces. It showcases my understanding of network programming concepts, socket communication, and web technologies in both Arabic and English environments.

## Project Description

This is a socket and HTML project that demonstrates:
- Socket programming for network communication
- HTML interfaces for user interaction
- Bilingual support (Arabic and English)
- Network protocol implementation
- Client-server architecture

## Files Overview

Based on the repository structure:

- **`README.md`** - Project documentation (this file)
- **`css_Arr.txt`** - CSS styling for Arabic interface
- **`css_eng.txt`** - CSS styling for English interface  
- **`html_arr.txt`** - HTML structure for Arabic version
- **`html_eng.txt`** - HTML structure for English version
- **`reportnetwork.pdf`** - Project documentation and analysis report

## Features

### Network Programming
- Socket-based client-server communication
- Network protocol implementation
- Real-time data transmission
- Connection management

### Web Interface
- **Bilingual Support** - Arabic and English interfaces
- **Responsive Design** - CSS styling for both languages
- **User-Friendly Interface** - HTML-based interaction
- **Cross-Language Compatibility** - RTL (Arabic) and LTR (English) support

### Technical Implementation
- Socket programming in [programming language used]
- HTML/CSS for frontend presentation
- Network communication protocols
- Multi-language interface design

## Technologies Used

- **Network Programming**: Sockets, TCP/UDP protocols
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Languages**: [Programming language - likely C/C++, Python, or Java]
- **Documentation**: PDF reporting
- **Internationalization**: Arabic and English language support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Programming language runtime/compiler]
- Web browser for HTML interface
- Network connectivity for socket communication
- Support for Arabic text rendering (for Arabic interface)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lamaRimawi/network.git
   cd network
   ```

2. **Set up the project:**
   ```bash
   # Compile the socket program (if applicable)
   gcc -o server server.c
   gcc -o client client.c
   
   # Or for other languages
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Prepare HTML interfaces:**
   ```bash
   # Copy HTML and CSS files to web directory
   cp html_eng.txt index_en.html
   cp html_arr.txt index_ar.html
   cp css_eng.txt style_en.css
   cp css_arr.txt style_ar.css
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Socket Server
```bash
# Start the server
./server [port_number]

# Or for Python
python server.py
```

### Running the Client
```bash
# Connect to server
./client [server_ip] [port_number]

# Or for Python
python client.py
```

### Accessing Web Interface

1. **English Interface:**
   - Open `index_en.html` in your browser
   - Uses `style_en.css` for styling

2. **Arabic Interface:**
   - Open `index_ar.html` in your browser
   - Uses `style_ar.css` for RTL styling
